# Group Contribution: Mudasir

There was no set division, most of the work was done collectively. However, Kainat was responsible for all the heavy styling that we did, as well as model and database creation. I was responsible for the API as well as other basic features. The rest of the work was either done collectively as a group, or both members tried and one succeded.

Humraah - Project Completion Update:

The project with all of its functionalities was fully implemented as mentioned in the proposal. We were also able to keep a track of
history which is basically a User’s previous bookings and incorporate the functionality of allowing a user to sort available ambulances
according to the distance from the user’s location. Both of these were not a part of the project scope initially defined. Project
requirements including CSS, Custom routing, AJAX, Cookies, API, Caching, LINQ and authorized access were fully implemented and displayed 
during the demo.

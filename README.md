## Instructions to run:

Clone the folders named Humraaah and DistanceAPI. All the packages are included so there is no need to install any additional dependandies.

## Completion status:

The project with all of its functionalities was fully implemented as mentioned in the proposal. We were also able to keep a track of history which is basically a User’s previous bookings and incorporate the functionality of allowing a user to sort available ambulances according to the distance from the user’s location. Both of these were not a part of the project scope initially defined. The following project requirements were fully incorporated:

- CSS 
- Custom routing 
- AJAX
- Cookies
- .NET WebAPI 
- Caching 
- LINQ for database manipulation
- authorized access (public vs private pages, public vs private access)
- role based authentication and authorization.
